# Weather_forecasting
Weather Forecasting GUI using Java (JSwing)
Note: To use the application:
1) User has to create an API key from https://register.metoffice.gov.uk/WaveRegistrationClient/public/register.do?service=datapoint. After creating an API key, insert the API key in .java files where required. Hint: Open .java files, search for "API address here" using Ctrl + f and insert your API key.
2) Each local address of the txt file and image has to be changed to store the data on the local system of the user.  Hint open each .java file, press Ctrl + f to find ".txt" file and ".jpg" for image and change the address manually for your desktop file location. Below attached image shows an example on how to do this.

3) Open your desired IDE to run the code. Add the folder to the IDE. Add Json jar file to the referenced libraries (in vs-code) or in class path (in eclipse) to add Json libraries to the application. Json Jar is included in the folder. Below attached image shows an example on how to do this.
